# studyflow
Productivity tool that helps students transitioning to university with managing their tasks. Designed to help university students but can be used by anyone to manage their classwork and time. We plan to include features such as a to-do list, a built-in study timer, an assignments list sorted by priority, dark mode, trend charts to track your progress, and a calendar view for all tasks. It is a bundle of tools all in one.

Built using Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP, and PHPMyAdmin, hosted on the course website accessible to Mac students only for now.

Created by Raymond, Lucas, and Aiden for COMPSCI 1XD3 at McMaster University.

## Usage
Easy to use productivity tools all in one webpage. You can create/edit/complete tasks which will also update the chart in real time. To keep track of your study sessions, use the timer by choosing a time before pressing Start, add or subtract time when it has already been started, if you try refreshing the page while its running it'll ask you if you really want to quit, and a nice ringtone plays when time's up. You can also go into dark mode by pressing the icon next to Logout.
